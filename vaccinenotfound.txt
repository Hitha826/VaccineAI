Medical experts have warned that the volume of vaccine available to fight the coronavirus or SARS-CoV-2 in coming years is expected to fall far short of global demand, despite an unprecedented effort to manufacture billions of doses. About 70 per cent of the world's population -- or 5.6 billion people -- will probably need to be inoculated to begin to establish herd immunity and slow its spread, The Washington Post reported citing scientific research on Monday.</p>, <p>The scenario public health experts fear most is a worldwide fight in which manufacturers will sell only to the highest bidders, rich countries trying to buy up the supplies, and nations where manufacturers have located hoard vaccines for their own citizens.</p>, <p>"The model of countries thinking only of themselves is not going to work. Even if you're living somewhere that's somehow perfectly without any infections, your best efforts to fight the virus are going to fail unless you shut off all your borders and trade," said Seth Berkley, CEO of Gavi, a public-private partnership that helps provide vaccines to developing countries.</p>, <p>"This is a global problem that requires a global solution," he added.</p>, <p>International health advocates want to avoid a repeat of 2009, when wealthy countries -- including the United States, led by former President Barack Obama -- were at the head of the line for H1N1 swine-flu vaccine, leaving underdeveloped countries with little supply until after the <a href="https://www.livemint.com/news/india/why-india-s-covid-count-remains-high-despite-lockdown-11589300259404.html" target="_blank">pandemic</a> subsided.</p>, <p>Such an approach will be sorely tested by current US President Trump and other world leaders with nationalistic impulses and their own anxious populations that want to reduce the deadly threat and bring their economies back to life.</p>, <p>In the United States, the federal government agency in charge of emergency vaccine development indicated it is prioritizing domestic concerns -- an "America First" mentality that has shaped much of the Trump administration's pandemic response.</p>, <p>"Right now, we're focused on the whole-of-America approach required to expedite the availability of vaccines," Gary Disbrow, acting director of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), said in an emailed response to the Post.</p>, <p>BARDA, tasked with protecting Americans from biological threats, is channeling nearly half a billion dollars in emergency funds to Johnson &amp; Johnson to develop a vaccine. It also is providing hundreds of millions of dollars in financial support for vaccine efforts by Sanofi, the large French drug company, and Moderna, a biotech company in Massachusetts teaming with a Swiss company for vaccine manufacturing.</p>, <p>The global grab for protective equipment and ventilators that left poorer countries empty-handed suggests the competition over vaccines could be at least as fierce. Dozens of companies large and small are rushing to develop vaccines using different technologies and approaches.</p>, <p>The race for a vaccine is full of risks because no one knows which projects will succeed. That forces companies to scale up to produce millions of doses of vaccine that might end up being worthless.</p>, <p>It should also be noted that the United States might not be well-positioned if the best vaccines end up coming from other countries or international collaborations.</p>, <p>This race could make large drug companies enter into vaccine contracts again as they face pressure to recoup their investments, the newspaper said further.</p>, <p>"Rich countries monopolized the vaccine, poor countries were left behind," Gavin Yamey, director of the Center for Policy Impact in Global Health at Duke University, said in a university podcast.</p>, <p>"They got the vaccine later, and they got less of it." Allowing a repeat scenario in the battle against the coronavirus would be a devastating mistake, he said.</p>, <p>"Unless we make this vaccine globally available," he said, "we are not going to be able to end the pandemic, because ... an outbreak anywhere is an outbreak everywhere."</p>, <p><span><a class="desktopTxt" href="https://epaper.livemint.com/Home/ArticleView?utm_source=livemintstory&amp;utm_medium=lmstorybottom&amp;utm_campaign=lmstoryref" target="_blank">Click here</a> to read the Mint ePaper</span>

Let's work together to keep the conversation civil.</p>, <p>Now Reading: </p>, <p>Nations around the world have closed their borders and ordered a strict lockdown in order to avoid further pressure on the already overwhelmed medical care system. With more than 4.3 million cases globally and close to 2,92,899 deaths, novel coronavirus continues to wreak havoc across the globe.<br/></p>, <p>At the same time, scientists and researchers across the globe are racing against the time to develop a <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-news/italy-claims-to-develop-first-covid-19-vaccine-here-is-the-current-status-of-all-the-potential-coronavirus-vaccines/photostory/75575319.cms">vaccine</a> for the novel coronavirus. As of now, almost 100 research groups are working round the clock to develop a potential vaccine for COVID-19. </p>, <p>It is important to note that a vaccine fit for humans usually takes years to develop as it goes through a series of human trials to test its safety and efficiency. The World Health Organization is tracking the potential vaccines for COVID-19 in the clinical evaluation<br/></p>, <p> <strong>Here’s taking a look at the four potential vaccines which are leading the race: </strong></p>, <p>The University of Oxford has developed a vaccine candidate ‘ChAdOx1 nCoV-19’ in under three months. The vaccine candidate uses a weakened strain of common cold virus (adenovirus) and is combined with the genetic material of the SARS-CoV-2 (the coronavirus causing COVID-19).<br/></p>, <p> This will enable the body to identify the spike protein of the novel coronavirus. The vaccine candidate is now in a clinical trial phase-1 and healthy volunteers have already been injected to check its safety and efficiency. </p>, <p>In the US, the Massachusetts-based biotech company Moderna is developing an RNA based vaccine in collaboration with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). The vaccine candidate mRNA-1273 has already conducted phase 1 trials and is all set to begin phase 2 trials. The RNA vaccine works by entering the human cells and carries the molecular instructions to make the viral protein. Once, this viral protein is recognized by the body, the immune system of the body is triggered.<br/></p>, <p>Chinese scientists are claiming to have successfully tested a potential vaccine for the novel coronavirus in monkeys. To conduct this experiment, the researchers injected the monkeys with the potential vaccine PiCoVacc which is made by Sinovac Biotech, a Chinese biopharmaceutical company. The monkeys were later exposed to novel coronavirus and it was found that those injected with a dose of the potential vaccine were largely protected from the virus. The vaccine is currently undergoing human clinical trials.<br/></p>, <p>US-based Pfizer pharmaceutical company and its German partner BioNtech are working together on four RNA vaccine candidates. They also began clinical trials of their vaccine candidate BNT162. Their vaccine candidate is based on specially designed messenger RNA (similar to the Moderna vaccine) and the trails for testing the vaccine are taking place in the USA and they plan to test the potential vaccine on 360 healthy volunteers. <br/></p>, <p>As per recent reports, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has teamed up with Bharat Biotech International Limited (BBIL) for developing COVID-19 vaccine.  It is important to note that the vaccine will use the virus strain isolated at the National Institute of Virology (NIV), in Pune. The strain has been successfully transferred from NIV to BBIL.<br/></p>, <p>Moreover, the Serum Institute of India (SII), which is the world’s largest maker of vaccines by volume, has  partnered with Oxford University to produce up to 60 million doses of a potential vaccine.</p>, <p>Inovio Pharmaceuticals, a biotechnology company received 5 million dollars aid for developing a vaccine for the novel coronavirus. Located in Plymouth Meeting, Pennsylvania, the pharmaceuticals has developed a potential vaccine in its San Diego lab and is all set to begin Phase 1 trial at the University of Pennsylvania. The vaccine is named INO-4800 and each volunteer will receive two doses of the relatively novel DNA-based vaccine candidate, four weeks apart to check its efficiency and safety.</p>, <p>The Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) live-attenuated vaccine candidate is in the phase 2/3 and is used against tuberculosis to boost the immune system. Clinical trials are being conducted to test the effectivity and safety of this vaccine candidate in protecting people against COVID-19. </p>, <p>How social media is helping farmers take produce straight to kitchens</p>, <p>Learning to live with coronavirus</p>, <p>What the elderly fear most in times of Covid-19</p>, <p>Covid-19: Train travel in India will not be the same any more</p>, <p>Airtel Xstream Fiber</p>, <p>Style &amp; Life</p>, <p>Deccan Rummy</p>][<p class="byline__name byline__name--block">

            </p>, <p class="caption">Engineers work on a potential vaccine for the coronavirus at a Beijing lab.</p>, <p>Most health experts agree that the need for a vaccine to prevent COVID-19 is clear.</p>, <p>"To return to a semblance of previous normality, the development of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines is an absolute necessity" is how a <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2020/05/08/science.abc5312">perspective</a> in <em>Science </em>magazine puts it.</p>, <p>So it's hardly surprising that, around the world, anticipation is high. With more than 100 coronavirus vaccines under development, researchers are reasonably confident that at least one will be successful. Skeptics, and there are some, remind us that optimism about an AIDS vaccine was once high, and 40 years later there is no vaccine.</p>, <p>Still, even if experts today are right that a vaccine for COVID-19 will be easier to develop than an AIDS vaccine, estimates for when it will be widely available vary. Here are some of the vaccine-related questions being raised — and what we know at this point.</p>, <p><strong>Is the timeline for COVID-19 faster than for previous vaccines?</strong></p>, <p>President Trump has offered perhaps the most optimistic estimate. He said he expects the United States to have a vaccine by the end of 2020. </p>, <p>So far, it does seem as though the vaccine will be developed faster than ever before in vaccine history. It took more than two decades to come up with a successful polio vaccine. Federal health officials suggest a COVID-19 vaccine may be ready in a tenth of that time.</p>, <p>But there are only some things that you can fast-track, and others, not so much. And even though the Food and Drug Administration is going to be evaluating the various stages of testing with great speed in this case, certain standards must be met: First, you have to prove that a vaccine is safe. Then you need to prove that it generates the immune response you want. And then you need to find out if it actually prevents people from getting sick if they're exposed to the virus. </p>, <p><strong>How would researchers know they have developed a vaccine that works?</strong></p>, <p>Vaccine studies present researchers with a conundrum: You want people to be exposed to the disease being targeted because you need to know if your vaccine is working, and yet in another sense you don't want them being exposed because you don't want them to get sick. </p>, <p>The way you know that the vaccine is effective is that you give a vaccine to one group of people and another group gets a sham injection that doesn't contain the vaccine being tested. Then you see if the vaccinated group is protected.  </p>, <p>So how are they going to get exposed to, in this case, the novel coronavirus? Well, if there's a lot of virus circulating in the population, that's one way. </p>, <p>Another possibility that people have talked about is intentionally infecting volunteers with the virus and then seeing if a candidate vaccine prevents them from getting sick. That way you know for sure that the volunteer testers have been exposed and can be confident the vaccine works if that person does not get sick. Such studies, known as challenge trials, are ethically fraught, since you are deliberately infecting volunteers with a potentially lethal virus for which there is no cure.</p>, <p>The alternative to challenge trials is to vaccinate enough people so that you can be confident that some<strong> </strong>fraction of them will be exposed to the virus. The number you need to vaccinate depends on how prevalent the coronavirus is in the area where the vaccine is being tested. You then compare the vaccinated group with another group that received a sham vaccine to look for efficacy. </p>, <p><strong>Once a vaccine has been developed, how does the manufacturing process work?</strong></p>, <p>"The requirement to scale up to the kinds of numbers we're talking about within the short time-frame that we're speaking about would be an extraordinary effort," says <a href="https://www.gatesfoundation.org/who-we-are/general-information/leadership/global-health/emilio-emini">Emilio Emini</a>, who has been working on vaccines for decades and now leads the HIV program at the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation (which is a funder of NPR and of this blog). </p>, <p>Making billions of doses of vaccine is a herculean task.</p>, <p>The tools that you need for manufacturing one vary considerably depending on the kind of vaccine you're making, but in many cases, you need something called a bioreactor — a giant tank that allows the organisms that are actually spewing out the vaccine of interest to grow. </p>, <p>Sometimes you could be talking about a 20,000-gallon bioreactor, and you're not going to go down to your local hardware store and pick one of those up. So that's one issue. There's specialty equipment that has to be made.</p>, <p>In addition to the big stuff, there are smaller things to take into consideration, such as medical-grade glass.</p>, <p>"You have to put a product into a sterile vial or syringe, and there's only so much of that glass to go around," says <a href="https://aspatx.com/team-member/fred-porter-ph-d/">Fred Porter</a>, senior vice president for technical operations at Adrenas Therapeutics. "If we're thinking about billions of doses to be able to deliver vaccines around the world, that becomes a significant bottleneck."</p>, <p><strong>Is making a vaccine available globally important? </strong></p>, <p>Definitely.</p>, <p><a href="https://www.gavi.org/operating-model/gavi-secretariat/seth-berkley">Seth Berkley</a>, CEO of an organization called Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, believes you can't roll out a vaccine one country at a time.</p>, <p>"We're not going to be safe as a world unless everywhere is safe," he says. "So even if we had parts of the world that would have low spread or no spread, if you had large reservoirs of the virus in other places, of course you have a risk of reintroduction."</p>, <p><strong>With more than 100 vaccines in development around the world, is it safe to say the majority of them are never going to become viable candidates?</strong></p>, <p>Yes.</p>, <p>They may not succeed for a variety of reasons. They may not work, or they work but are too hard to manufacture. At this stage of development, many are expected to fail. That's just the nature of vaccine trials. </p>, <p><strong>Is it possible that we don't get just one vaccine but that multiple vaccines are developed that might work even in somewhat different ways?</strong></p>, <p>It seems likely because there are multiple approaches to making vaccines that have advantages and disadvantages. Some are tried and true and have worked for other viral illnesses. Some you can make much faster, but it's unclear that they'll be as effective. Experts such as Emilio Emini believe the parallel development of multiple vaccines is a good thing.</p>, <p>"It's my perspective that this is going to require more than one successful vaccine," he says. "It's going to require at least several, if not more, that are successfully developed in parallel so that the scope of what will be needed can be satisfied."<strong> </strong></p>, <p><strong>Will the coronavirus vaccine be like the annual flu vaccine in that it changes every year because the virus changes every year, or will it be more like the measles or the polio vaccine, which is fixed?</strong></p>, <p>Unfortunately, right now the answer is unclear. There is some indication that this virus doesn't change very rapidly, so if you find a vaccine that works against it, it may work in perpetuity. But researchers also don't know how long immunity to this virus lasts, so we may need to get booster shots — not a different shot every year but a booster of the same shot to make the vaccine actually work for multiple years.</p>, <p><strong>How hopeful should we be that there will be a vaccine that works and that we can get our hands on by next year?</strong></p>, <p>Several companies, governments and foundations are betting billions of dollars that it will be possible.</p>, <p><a href="https://www.jnj.com/leadership/paul-stoffels-md?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=GO-USA-ENG-PS-Corporate+Equity-BC-EX-RN-BRAND_LEADERSHIP&amp;utm_content=Paul+Stoffels+-+E&amp;utm_term=paul+stoffels+johnson+and+johnson&amp;ds_rl=1262818&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwkun1BRAIEiwA2mJRWVYtzl8cXWEgzwpb2V_eMlJQWlSyq-MMiSIQxayiJ_DSFQmx3LVZehoCfVgQAvD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds">Paul Stoffels</a>, chief scientific officer for Johnson &amp; Johnson, says he's optimistic because of his company's recent experience making vaccines for other viral diseases. </p>, <p>"We have done it with Zika, RSV (respiratory syncytial virus), Ebola," he says. "We know what we do. And if we plug a new virus into that system, we are pretty sure we can get to a vaccine."<strong> </strong></p>, <p>That said, vaccine people will tell you that every time you start working on a vaccine for a new virus, you don't know what the hurdles will be. There's a lot of work that needs to be done before we know for sure whether those bets will pay off. </p>, <p class="left">NPR thanks our sponsors</p>, <p class="right"><a href="/about-npr/186948703/corporate-sponsorship">Become an NPR sponsor</a></p>][<p>In her second press conference in as many days, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Thursday unveiled an economic package to help alleviate the distress for small farmers, migrant workers, small traders and self-employed people under the “Atmanirbhar Bharat (self-reliant)” campaign announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Currently, there is no vaccine to prevent <abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr>, but researchers are racing to create one.</p>, <p>Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that cause illnesses such as the common cold, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). <abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr> is caused by a virus that's closely related to the one that causes <abbr title="severe acute respiratory syndrome">SARS</abbr>. For this reason, scientists named the new virus <abbr title="severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2">SARS-CoV-2</abbr>.</p>, <p>While vaccine development can take years, researchers aren't starting from scratch to develop a <abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr> vaccine. Past research on <abbr title="severe acute respiratory syndrome">SARS</abbr> and <abbr title="Middle East respiratory syndrome">MERS</abbr> vaccines has identified potential approaches. </p>, <p>Coronaviruses have a spike-like structure on their surface called an S protein. (The spikes create the corona-like, or crown-like, appearance that gives the viruses their name.) The S protein attaches to the surface of human cells. A vaccine that targets this protein would prevent it from binding to human cells and stop the virus from reproducing. </p>, <p>Past research on vaccines for coronaviruses has also identified some challenges to developing a <abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr> vaccine, including:</p>, <p>Global health authorities and vaccine developers are currently partnering to support the technology needed to produce vaccines. Some approaches have been used before to create vaccines, but some are still quite new.</p>, <p>Live vaccines use a weakened (attenuated) form of the germ that causes a disease. This kind of vaccine prompts an immune response without causing disease. The term attenuated means that the vaccine's ability to cause disease has been reduced.</p>, <p>Live vaccines are used to protect against measles, mumps, rubella, smallpox and chickenpox. As a result, the infrastructure is in place to develop these kinds of vaccines. </p>, <p>However, live virus vaccines often need extensive safety testing. Some live viruses can be transmitted to a person who isn't immunized. This is a concern for people who have weakened immune systems.</p>, <p>Inactivated vaccines use a killed (inactive) version of the germ that causes a disease. This kind of vaccine causes an immune response but not infection. Inactivated vaccines are used to prevent the flu, hepatitis A and rabies.</p>, <p>However, inactivated vaccines may not provide protection that's as strong as that produced by live vaccines. This type of vaccine often requires multiple doses, followed by booster doses, to provide long-term immunity. Producing these types of vaccines might require the handling of large amounts of the infectious virus.</p>, <p>This type of vaccine uses genetically engineered <abbr title="ribonucleic acid">RNA</abbr> or <abbr title="deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr> that has instructions for making copies of the S protein. These copies prompt an immune response to the virus. With this approach, no infectious virus needs to be handled. While genetically engineered vaccines are in the works, none has been licensed for human use. </p>, <p>The development of vaccines can take years. This is especially true when the vaccines involve new technologies that haven't been tested for safety or adapted to allow for mass production. </p>, <p>Why does it take so long? First, a vaccine is tested in animals to see if it works and if it's safe. This testing must follow strict lab guidelines and generally takes three to six months. The manufacturing of vaccines also must follow quality and safety practices.</p>, <p>Next comes testing in humans. Small phase I clinical trials evaluate the safety of the vaccine in humans. During phase II, the formulation and doses of the vaccine are established to prove the vaccine's effectiveness. Finally, during phase III, the safety and efficacy of a vaccine need to be demonstrated in a larger group of people.</p>, <p>Because of the seriousness of the <abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr> pandemic, vaccine regulators might fast-track some of these steps. But it's unlikely that a <abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr> vaccine will become available sooner than six months after clinical trials start. Realistically, a vaccine will take 12 to 18 months or longer to develop and test in human clinical trials. And we don't know yet whether an effective vaccine is possible for this virus.</p>, <p>If a vaccine is approved, it will take time to produce, distribute and administer to the global population. Because people have no immunity to <abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr>, it's likely that two vaccinations will be needed, three to four weeks apart. People would likely start to achieve immunity to <abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr> one to two weeks after the second vaccination. </p>, <p>A lot of work remains. Still, the number of pharmaceutical companies, governments and other agencies working on a <abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr> vaccine is cause for hope.</p>, <p>Until a <abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr> vaccine is available, infection prevention is crucial. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend following these precautions for avoiding <abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr>: </p>, <p>If you have a chronic medical condition and may have a higher risk of serious illness, check with your doctor about other ways to protect yourself.</p>, <p>Any use of this site constitutes your agreement to the Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy linked below.
